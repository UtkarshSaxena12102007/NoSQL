# MongoDB_Student_Database_Project
📚 MongoDB Student Database Project | Complete CRUD operations, query operators, student records management, and MongoDB Shell (mongosh) commands for academic/practical use.
# 📚 MongoDB Student Database Operations

A complete academic MongoDB project demonstrating student database management using **MongoDB Shell (mongosh)**. This project covers database creation, student record insertion, updating, deletion, querying, and verification operations.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **MongoDB Student Database Project** demonstrates practical **NoSQL database operations** using MongoDB.

The project uses:

* **Database:** `studentProjectDB`
* **Collection:** `studentRecords`
* **Initial Records:** 51
* **Roll Numbers:** 101–151
* **Final Records After Deletions:** 44
* **Department Counts After Deletions:** CSE 11, IT 11, ECE 11, ME 11

The project covers **Insert, Update, Delete, Query, and Verification operations**.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **MongoDB**
* **MongoDB Shell (mongosh)**
* **NoSQL Database**
* **MongoDB Query Language**

## 📊 Student Record Structure

Each student record contains information such as:

```text
rollNo
name
age
department
marks
```

Some update operations also demonstrate the use of:

```text
status
```

### Example Student Record

```json
{
  "rollNo": 101,
  "name": "Aarush",
  "age": 18,
  "department": "CSE",
  "marks": 86
}
```

---

# 🔄 Operations Covered

## 1. Create / Select Database

The project uses the following MongoDB database:

```text
studentProjectDB
```

---

## 2. Insert One

Demonstrates inserting a single student record into the `studentRecords` collection.

Example student:

```text
Roll No.: 201
Name: Aarush
Age: 18
Department: CSE
Marks: 88
```

---

## 3. Insert Many

Demonstrates inserting multiple student records.

The project contains records from:

```text
Roll No. 102 – 151
```

Departments include:

* CSE
* IT
* ECE
* ME

---

## 4. Update One

Demonstrates updating a particular student's record.

Example:

```text
Roll No. 101
Marks: 88 → 92
```

---

## 5. Update Many

Demonstrates updating multiple documents based on a condition.

Example:

```text
CSE students → status: "Active"
```

---

## 6. Delete One

Demonstrates deleting a specific student record.

Example:

```text
Roll No. 151
```

---

## 7. Delete Many

Demonstrates deleting multiple records based on a condition.

Example:

```text
Marks < 40
```

---

# 🔎 Query Operations

The project demonstrates several MongoDB comparison operators.

### `$gt` — Greater Than

Find students whose marks are greater than 80.

```text
marks > 80
```

### `$lt` — Less Than

Find students whose marks are less than 80.

```text
marks < 80
```

### `$eq` — Equal To

Find students whose marks are exactly 85.

```text
marks = 85
```

### `$gte` — Greater Than or Equal To

Find students whose marks are greater than or equal to 80.

```text
marks >= 80
```

### `$ne` — Not Equal To

Find students whose marks are not equal to 85.

```text
marks ≠ 85
```

---

# 🧠 Logical Operators

## `$and`

Find students satisfying both conditions:

```text
Marks > 70
AND
Age < 23
```

---

## `$or`

Find students belonging to either:

```text
CSE
OR
ECE
```

---

## `$not`

Find students whose marks are **not greater than 80**.

---

# 📋 Verification Operations

The project also demonstrates basic database verification commands, including:

* Show current database
* Show collections
* Display all student records
* Display records in readable format
* Count total documents
* Count CSE students
* Count ECE students
* Count IT students
* Count ME students

---

# 🔍 Student Search Operations

The project demonstrates different ways to search student records.

### Find Student by Roll Number

Example:

```text
Roll No. 101
```

### Find CSE Students

Retrieves all students belonging to the CSE department.

### Find ECE Students

Retrieves all students belonging to the ECE department.

### Find IT Students

Retrieves all students belonging to the IT department.

### Find ME Students

Retrieves all students belonging to the ME department.
